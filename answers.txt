Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
This is cooperative scheduling. If you look at schedos-1.c, it calls sys_yield()after each character it prints. The scheduler then use a round-robin scheduling algorithm to pick the next available (runnable) process to run. Hence the output of "123412341234...".
